So here it is&#8230; My blog. I thought about changing the title of this one, but as a programmer, &#8220;hello world&#8221; just seems very fitting for the first of anything. This blog was started because a co-worker suggested that I start a blog and write about general technology advances and tools that &#8220;old-school&#8221; users may not know about. So here ya go Red.

I will undoubtedly use this for a number of other things as well, but keep an eye out for articles on a weekly basis targeted toward people that are less technologically inclined than my generation.

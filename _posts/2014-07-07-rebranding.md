When I started this blog many moons ago, I was sitting in my college dorm room at Virginia Tech. My long time followers will remember the old name &#8220;Tech From Tech&#8221;, which was a play on the type of content I was writing (technical education for the masses)  and the college I went to. It has been years since I left VT, and while I will always love the Hokies &#8211; it is time for a change.

That said &#8211; today marks the first day in my rebranding. You&#8217;ll notice the blog is now titled &#8220;Night Shift Writing&#8221;. Why you ask? Because peak performance happens at night. This has been especially true for me over the past few years. It is also no accident this re-branding coincides with the start of my new company &#8211; Night Shift Development &#8211; the same company under which I recently released my first app for iOS, [Writer&#8217;s Block][1]. More on that later.

Expect to see more writing from me going forward. I&#8217;m going to aim to write more shorter posts with longer ones scattered in between. Keep on the lookout.

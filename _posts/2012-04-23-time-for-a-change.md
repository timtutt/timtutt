So as you have undoubtedly already noticed, the site has gone through a major facelift. It took me all of 5 minutes to make the decision when I started searching for new themes. Ran across this one over at <a href="http://www.nullin.com/hemingwayex/" target="_blank">NULL.in</a>Â and thought it was pretty amazing. Quick install, and boom I&#8217;m done. I think I&#8217;ll stick with this one for a bit. Not the only technical change I&#8217;ll be making, but more on that later.

You should all also expect me to pick back up on writing a lot more starting soon. I&#8217;ve got a lot of posts that I&#8217;ve had in draft for a while, that will be finished, and many other ideas in the works. Focus will remain largely on the technical side, with some of my other rantings here and there. We&#8217;ll also have a few special guest writers, but again&#8230; more on that later.

For now, enjoy the new theme. Re-read some old stuff, and be on the look out for the new things coming.
